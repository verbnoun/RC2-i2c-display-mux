## Current Focus: HID Multiplexer Libraries & Scanning

Moving on to HID input systems with multiplexer support for buttons, encoders, and other controls.

### Next Tasks
- HID multiplexer library development
- Input scanning systems
- Button matrix implementation
- Encoder reading with multiplexers

## Recent Work Completed (Today)

### Graphics & Display Libraries Documentation
- Created comprehensive README for ssd1306_graphics library (71+ functions documented)
- Rewrote i2c_display_mux README with practical coordination patterns
- Clarified library independence - mux and graphics are separate but coordinate
- Added real-world examples without referencing validation projects
- Documented known issues (text boundary calculations WIP)

### Display System Status
- **Graphics Library**: Production ready with full Japanese font support (249 chars)
- **Mux Library**: Production ready for 8-channel display management
- **Font System**: Three sizes working perfectly (8px, 10px, 12px)
- **Smart Text**: Auto-clearing and XOR rendering implemented

## Hardware Configuration
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350)
- **Display**: 5x SSD1306 OLEDs via TCA9548A
- **I2C**: GP14 (SDA), GP15 (SCL) on I2C1
- **Next**: HID input multiplexers

## Development Environment
- **Build Tools**: pico-tools with auto-flash support
- **Libraries Path**: Environment variable based (no relative paths)
- **Project Structure**: ValidateC (testing), BartlebyC (controller), CandideC (synth)
