## Current Focus: HID Multiplexer Libraries & Scanning

Moving on to HID input systems with multiplexer support for buttons, encoders, and other controls.

### Next Tasks
- HID multiplexer library development
- Input scanning systems
- Button matrix implementation
- Encoder reading with multiplexers

## Recent Work Completed (Today)

### Graphics & Display Libraries Documentation
- Created comprehensive README for ssd1306_graphics library (71+ functions documented)
- Rewrote i2c_display_mux README with practical coordination patterns
- Clarified library independence - mux and graphics are separate but coordinate
- Added real-world examples without referencing validation projects
- Documented known issues (text boundary calculations WIP)

### Project Template System
- Created Attach Part foundation template in `pico-tools/templates/attach-part/`
- Extracted professional patterns from graphics_validation (console logging, git versioning, command interface)
- Hardware-agnostic foundation ready for any project type
- Includes console_logger integration and interactive debugging from day one

### Library Status
- **Graphics Library**: Production ready with UTF-8 native API and smart character spacing (proper romanji half-width + Japanese full-width)
- **Mux Library**: Production ready for 8-channel display management  
- **Console Logger**: Production ready with tag-based color logging
- **Template System**: Professional foundation template available

## Hardware Configuration
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350)
- **Display**: 5x SSD1306 OLEDs via TCA9548A
- **I2C**: GP14 (SDA), GP15 (SCL) on I2C1
- **Next**: HID input multiplexers

## Development Environment
- **Build Tools**: pico-tools with auto-flash support
- **Libraries Path**: Environment variable based (no relative paths)
- **Project Structure**: ValidateC (testing), BartlebyC (controller), CandideC (synth)
- **Template System**: `pico-init PROJECT_NAME attach-part` for new projects
